# ReactWebPage
First web page created by me based out of react JS
Download and install Node JS
Install the react library
Open Command Prompt as an Administrator and follow along the below steps.

--> mkdir ReactAssignment

--> cd ReactAssignment

--> npm init

--> npm install -g babel babel-cli

-->npm install webpack webpack-dev-server --save

--> npm install babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react

--> npm install react react-dom --save

--> npm install create-react-class

All the above commands will help to create simple Single page application.

Once your application is completed, use

--> npm start
I have also uploaded the video in GIT only, names as React_Assignment_Screencast


Thank You
